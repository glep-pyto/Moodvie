What is Moodvie? Moodvie is a platform that provides users with a personalized way to discover movies that match their emotions and preferences. 
By connecting moods with films, it creates a more engaging and enjoyable movie-watching experience.
This program encourages users to explore a wider variety of movies in a fun and meaningful way.

Moodvie is a mood-based movie recommender built with Python and Flask.
Users select a mood through emoji buttons, and the system generates matching movie recommendations. Each movie card displays the title, release year, language, description, and poster. Five results are shown first, with an option to load more.

The frontend is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and responsive experience, such as hover effects and glowing buttons.

Development was managed using Git and GitHub, with coding in Visual Studio Code. Media content like posters and the demo video were created using PowerPoint, Zoom, and Jianying.
